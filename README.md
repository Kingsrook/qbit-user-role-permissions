## QBit:  user-role-permissions

### Overview
*Note:  This is one of the original QBit implementations - so, some of the mechanics of how
it is loaded and used by an application are not exactly fully defined at the time of its
creation... Please excuse any dust or not-quite-round wheels you find here!*

This QBit provides tables for managing application permissions for users and roles.
